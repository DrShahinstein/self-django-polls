# Self Django Polls

A survey application whose answers are based on [likert scale](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/likert-scale/) (agree/disagree out of five) and primarily developed for [Team Voltran 2023](https://www.instagram.com/fll_voltran/), which competes in the First Lego League 2023-2024 challenge. For their innovative projects, they're going to survey people on the street and collect data on Jan 20, 2024. Good luck to them all!
